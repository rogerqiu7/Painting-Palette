#üñåÔ∏è Painting Palette
## Description
This is a painting palette app built using HTML, CSS and JS. It takes either user selected color or a random color and draws it on a palette that has a selected size. Inspiration and guide for this project is from The Odin Project course. You can access this project on my website or at the link in the "About" section of this page.
